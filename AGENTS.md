This repo is a **curated Markdown list** of resources, research, and tools for securing AI systems. Keep entries accurate, neutral, and consistently formatted. **No builds, no deps, no CI edits.**

## Scope
- ✅ Edit `README.md` entries, anchors, and section ordering.
- ❌ Don’t add dependencies/tools or touch repo settings.
- **Precedence:** if a subfolder ever has its own `AGENTS.md`, the **closest** file to what you edit wins.

## House style (must)
- **One-line entries.** Use: `- [Name](https://link) — short, neutral description.`
- **Separator:** en dash `—` (not a hyphen) between link and description.
- **Tone:** Neutral, factual, vendor-agnostic. No marketing fluff.
- **Casing:** Keep official project names/caps as published.
- **Images:** Do **not** add decorative graphics.
- **Sections:** Use the canonical labels; don’t invent new ones.

## GitHub stars (when used)
Use a social stars badge for GitHub repos where stars are requested.
```
- [Project — @owner](https://github.com/owner/repo) [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/owner/repo?logo=github&label=&style=social)](https://github.com/owner/repo) — <≤25-word neutral description>.
```

## Sorting
- If a subsection says “sort by stars” → **descending by star count**.
- Otherwise → **alphabetical by project name**.

## Canonical section labels (use exactly)
- **Third-Party Assessment** (replaces “Vendor Risk & TPRM”)
- **Research Feed** (not “Index”)
- **Attack & Defense Matrices** → subsections **Attack** / **Defense**
- **Agentic Systems — Governance, Standards & Guides**
- **Standards & Specs** (under Supply Chain Security)

## Quick PR checklist
- Style matches rules (en dash, one line, neutral).
- Sections/anchors correct and consistent.
- Sorting correct (stars vs alphabetical).
- Links valid; no duplicates.
- Description concise (≈20–25 words).
