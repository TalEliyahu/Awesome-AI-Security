The model spans five core domains: Strategy, Design, Implementation, Operations, and Governance. Each domain includes actionable maturity levels to guide adoption and improvement.

- [Design Principles for LLM-based Systems with Zero Trust](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7361109040367611904) - Six principles from Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) and ANSSI - Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information outline how to apply Zero Trust to LLM-based systems, reducing attack surfaces, detecting threats early, and ensuring safe, transparent operation.

- [Strengthening Emergency Preparedness and Response for AI Loss of Control Incidents](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7361039631129227266) -  

- [AI Security Solutions Landscape - Agentic AI Q3 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7360665992500273152) - The Solutions Landscape monitors and maps the full Agentic AI lifecycle, focusing on the DevOps–SecOps intersection to meet evolving security needs. Guided by the Agentic AI Threats and Mitigations guide and SecOps tasks, it highlights open-source and commercial solutions by stage, identifying their coverage of Agentic SecOps duties and threat mitigation, and leverages industry and community input as a peer-reviewed resource for navigating agentic AI’s shifting security challenges. Updated Quarterly.

- [State of Agentic AI Security and Governance](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7359398882205683713) - The State of Agentic AI Security and Governance provides a comprehensive view of today’s landscape for securing and governing autonomous AI systems. It explores the frameworks, governance models, and global regulatory standards shaping responsible Agentic AI adoption. Designed for developers, security professionals, and decision-makers, the report serves as a practical guide for navigating the complexities of building, managing, and deploying agentic applications safely and effectively.

- [A Practical Guide for Building Robust AI/ML Pipeline Security](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358835243413360641) - An overview of DevSecOps practices that are applicable to MLSecOps. Lessons learned from DevSecOps can proactively address security challenges in the emerging AI/ML lifecycle.

- [Smart Cities and Critical Infrastructure AI Security Framework](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358680697135403010) - The Smart Cities Critical Infrastructure (SCCI) AI Framework is designed to provide a comprehensive, sector-agnostic approach to securing and optimizing the use of artificial intelligence across urban critical infrastructure domains. As cities increasingly rely on interconnected digital systems—ranging from emergency dispatch and healthcare to law enforcement and utilities—the need for robust, adaptable, and transparent AI governance becomes paramount. This framework addresses the unique challenges posed by AI integration, including data privacy, operational resilience, regulatory compliance, and the mitigation of emerging cyber threats.

- [Secure Agentic System Design: A Trait-Based Approach](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7357415085222318080) - CSAThis publication from the CSA AI Technology and Risk Working Group addresses the unique security challenges of agentic AI. As AI transitions from passive tools to autonomous decision-makers, traditional security frameworks struggle to contextualize these new risks. Instead, we need a trait-based approach to agentic system security that identifies fundamental patterns in agent behavior and their associated vulnerabilities.

- [The AI Oversight Gap - Cost of a Data Breach Report 2025](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7357597342088224769) - The report combines data from 600 actual breaches with 3,470 interviews of security and business leaders. It uses activity-based costing to quantify breach impacts across detection, response, notification, and lost business.
